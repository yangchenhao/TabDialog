How to useï¼š
add: Using add function to create tab box.
popup: Using popup function to create popup button.
close: using close function to create close button on each tab.

A Problem: I use XMLHttpRequest and try to redirect other website as demo. Please open 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' to make sure it can be shown corrrectly on Chrome.

The Popup button will be refreshed if added on the website of the tab. So I add it on beside from the close button.

Some screenshots attached as demo.
